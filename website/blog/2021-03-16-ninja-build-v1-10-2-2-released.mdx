The [xPack Ninja Build](https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io/ninja-build-xpack/)
is the **xPack** distribution of the
[Ninja](https://ninja-build.org) build system.

There are separate binaries for **Windows** (x64 and x86),
**macOS** (x64) and **GNU/Linux** (x64 and x86, arm64 and arm).

:::note Raspberry Pi

The main targets for the GNU/Linux Arm
binaries are the **Raspberry Pi** class devices (armv7l and aarch64;
armv6 is not supported).

:::

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

:::note

For consistency with the Node.js naming conventions, the names of the Intel 32-bit images are now suffixed with `-ia32`.

## Install

The easiest way to install this specific version, is by using **xpm**:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/ninja-build@${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion} -verbose
`} </CodeBlock>

Comprehensive instructions for installing **xPack Ninja Build** on different platforms
can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

The **xPack Ninja Build** is based on the official
[Ninja](https://ninja-build.org),
without any changes.

The current version is based on:

- Ninja release
[1.10.2](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases/tag/v1.10.1)
from Nov 28th, 2020.

## Bug fixes

- none

## Enhancements

- none

## Changes

Compared to the upstream version, the Windows version also supports
spawning scripts via `cmd.exe /c`. These scripts are used by **npm**/**xpm**
to redirect invocations to the global xPacks store.

## Known problems

- [#1] as discoverd after starting to use meson, starting applications on
  Windows was still problematic; fixed on 1.10.2-3.

## Documentation

The original documentation is available from:

- [https://ninja-build.org/manual.html](https://ninja-build.org/manual.html)

## Supported platforms

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The binaries were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

- x86/x64 GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- arm64/arm GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 16 Docker container
- x86/x64 Windows: all binaries were built with mingw-w64 GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- x64 macOS: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in a separate
  folder on macOS 10.10.5.

## Build

The scripts used to build this distribution are in:

- `distro-info/scripts`

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/ninja-build-xpack/blob/xpack/README-MAINTAINER.md) page.

## Travis tests

The first set of tests were performed on Travis, by running
a simple script to check if the binaries start on a wide range of
platforms and distributions:

- [test xPack Ninja Build on stable platforms](https://travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/ninja-build-xpack/builds/220286429)
- [test xPack Ninja Build on latest platforms](https://travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/ninja-build-xpack/builds/220286630)
