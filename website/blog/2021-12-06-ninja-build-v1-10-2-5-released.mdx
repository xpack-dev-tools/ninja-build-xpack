## Install

The easiest way to install this specific version, is by using **xpm**:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/ninja-build@${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion} -verbose
`} </CodeBlock>

Comprehensive instructions for installing **xPack Ninja Build** on different platforms
can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

The xPack Ninja Build generally follows the official
[Ninja Build](https://ninja-build.org) releases.

The current version is based on:

- Ninja release
[1.10.2](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases/tag/v1.10.2)
from Nov 28th, 2020.

## Changes

Compared to the upstream version, the Windows version also supports
spawning scripts via `cmd.exe /c`. These scripts are used by **npm**/**xpm**
to redirect invocations to the central packages repository.

## Bug fixes

- none

## Enhancements

- none

## Known problems

## Documentation

The original documentation is available in the `share/doc` folder.

## Build

The binaries for all supported platforms
(Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux) were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

The scripts used to build this distribution are in:

- `distro-info/scripts`

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/ninja-build-xpack/blob/xpack/README-MAINTAINER.md) page.

## CI tests

Before publishing, a set of simple tests were performed on an exhaustive
set of platforms. The results are available from:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/ninja-build-xpack/actions/)
- [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/ninja-build-xpack/builds/)

## Deprecation notices

### 32-bit support

Support for 32-bit x86 GNU/Linux and x86 Windows will most probably
be dropped in 2022. Support for 32-bit Arm GNU/Linux will be preserved
for a while, due to the large user base of 32-bit Raspberry Pi systems.

### GNU/Linux minimum requirements

Support for RedHat 7 will most probably be dropped in 2022, and the
minimum requirement will be raised to GLIBC 2.27, available starting
with Ubuntu 18 and RedHat 8.
